# Cubic-Bezier-Curve
Tool to create cubic Bezier curves based on your points positions.

# How to use it ?
You'll need the SFML library. I personnally used the 2.5.1 version.
Clone the repo and compile sources : a 1280*720 window appear with a circle, generated with the Bezier object.
Also, the window listen to user's click and generate points, control points, anchor points and finally the Bezier curve by itself.

# How can I reproduce the algorithm myself ?
I used several sources to do it by my own.
